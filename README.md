### About Me

I'm an ambitious and focused individual with a strong interest in software development. I'm driven by a passion for learning and skill development.
I've worked as a freelance graphic designer for private customers and now I'm developing a keen interest in the IT industry.
I want to connect with and reach people who can help, educate, and work together to build amazing projects for satisfying results.

Most importantly, I'm also a nerd at videogames and reading books in my spare time!


### Future Plans

My primary focus is to deepen my skills in front-end web development. I'm excited to explore modern frameworks and best practices. 
However, I'm also keen to gain a solid understanding of back-end and full-stack development to become a more versatile developer.
I'm eager to learn from the web development community and contribute by sharing my knowledge and experiences. I hope to collaborate 
with others who are passionate about learning and improving their skills.
